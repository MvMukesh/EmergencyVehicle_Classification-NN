## Problem: 
Delays of emergency vehicles such as ambulance & fire brigade (self driving car)

## Thought: 
Emergency vehicles face difficulty in passing through traffic, differentiating a vehicle into an emergency and non emergency category can be an important component in traffic monitoring

## Solution for now:
Build a Image classification model capable of classifying vehicle images.
